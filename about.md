I like to use Open Source for hobby projects and I'm also fortunate to
use Linux and Open Source software almost exclusively in my day job.

This blog is a place for me to publish short journal pieces and longer-form
articles to document results of things I've been working on or thinking about.

This blog is produced using Jekyll, and uses the Hydeout theme. No trackers are
used on this site.

Instead of a comments section on this blog, I encourage you to communicate via
[Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@simon).
